# 🎧 Model Card: Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

**VibeFinder 1.0** — a tiny content-based music recommender.

---

## 2. Intended Use

VibeFinder suggests 5 songs from a small 20-track catalog based on a user's
preferred genre, mood, target energy level, and whether they like acoustic
music. It assumes the user can articulate their taste as a few discrete
preferences, and that the catalog actually contains something close to what
they want.

**Intended for:** classroom exploration of how content-based recommenders
turn features into rankings, and how small scoring choices produce large
behavioral changes.

**Not intended for:** real product use, large catalogs, users who can't (or
shouldn't have to) describe their taste in rigid categorical terms, or any
setting where fairness across genres/artists matters.

---

## 3. How the Model Works

Imagine each song has a label for its *genre* (pop, lofi, rock...) and its *mood* (happy, chill, intense...), plus a dial from 0 to 1 for how energetic it is and another dial for how acoustic it is. The user fills out a tiny form: favorite genre, favorite mood, a target energy level, and whether they like acoustic songs.

For every song in the catalog, VibeFinder starts at zero and adds points:

- **+2 points** if the song's genre matches the user's favorite.
- **+1 point** if the song's mood matches.
- **Up to +1 point** for being close to the user's target energy. A perfect match gets the full point, and the farther off the song is, the smaller the bonus.
- **+0.5 points** if the user likes acoustic music and this song is very
acoustic.

Every song gets a number, VibeFinder sorts them from highest to lowest, and the top 5 come back. That's the whole idea: score, sort, slice.

**Changes from the starter logic.** The starter only printed one list for
one profile. I extended `main.py` to loop over four profiles (three normal, one adversarial), print each result with a human-readable explanation, and kept the scoring weights tunable at the top of `recommender.py` so I could run a weight-shift experiment.

## 4. Data

`data/songs.csv` contains **20 songs**, unchanged from the starter. Each
row has: id, title, artist, genre, mood, and numeric features (energy,
tempo_bpm, valence, danceability, acousticness).

**Genres represented:** pop (2), lofi (4), rock (1), ambient (2), jazz (2),
synthwave (2), indie pop (2), punk (1), hip hop (1), edm (1), r&b (1),
folk (1). Lofi is overrepresented; most other genres have one or two tracks.

**Moods represented:** chill, happy, intense, moody, relaxed, focused. Notably
absent: sad, angry, romantic, nostalgic, melancholic — common moods listeners
actually use.

**What's missing.** No classical, country, metal, k-pop, latin, reggae, or
world music. No language or lyric signals. No tempo-based matching. No signal
for song length, era, or artist popularity. A real music-taste landscape is
far wider than this catalog can represent.

---

## 5. Strengths

- **Well-represented profiles work well.** The Chill Lofi profile produced a
  coherent, intuitive top 5 (Library Rain, Midnight Coding, Study Fog, Focus
  Flow, Spacewalk Thoughts). Lofi is the densest genre in the dataset, so the
  recommender has enough material to actually *rank* within taste, not just
  retrieve.
- **Transparent explanations.** Every recommendation comes with a
  human-readable "Because: genre match (pop) +2.0; mood match (happy) +1.0;
  energy sim +0.97" line. A user can always see why a song ranked where it
  did — a property that expensive deep-learning recommenders often lack.
- **Energy similarity is well-behaved.** Rewarding proximity (rather than
  "higher is better") captures the fact that a chill listener wants
  low-energy songs and a gym listener wants high-energy ones — the same
  formula handles both without special cases.
- **Stable top-1.** Across the weight-shift experiment, the #1 pick never
  moved for any profile, which suggests the model genuinely agrees on "best
  fit" when a song matches on all three signals.

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

**Genre dominance.** Because the genre match is worth +2.0 (double any other signal),
a single genre hit can outscore a song that matches mood *and* energy perfectly. This
creates a "filter bubble": users who declare a genre rarely see cross-genre songs even
when those songs would objectively fit their vibe better.

**Dataset skew.** The 20-song catalog has only one track for several genres (punk, edm,
hip hop, folk, r&b). A user whose favorite genre is "folk" effectively gets one
guaranteed top hit and then falls back to mood/energy matches — there is no real
ranking *within* their taste.

**Silent failure on bad input.** A user asking for `mood: sad` gets no warning that
"sad" does not exist in the catalog; the mood term simply contributes 0 and the
recommendation silently ignores that preference (see the adversarial profile, where
"sad" was dropped and "pop + high energy" took over).

**Binary matching.** Genre and mood are strict equality checks — "indie pop" never
matches "pop", and "focused" never partially matches "chill", even though a human
listener would see the overlap.

## 7. Evaluation

I stress-tested the recommender with four user profiles:

1. **High-Energy Pop** — pop / happy / energy 0.85
2. **Chill Lofi** — lofi / chill / energy 0.35 / acoustic
3. **Deep Intense Rock** — rock / intense / energy 0.9
4. **Adversarial "Conflicted Listener"** — pop / sad / energy 0.9 / acoustic
   (mixes an upbeat genre with a sad mood that doesn't exist in the catalog)

**What matched intuition.** The Chill Lofi profile produced a clean, coherent top-5
(Library Rain, Midnight Coding, Study Fog, Focus Flow, Spacewalk Thoughts). Deep
Intense Rock correctly put Storm Runner on top by a wide margin.

**What surprised me.** "Gym Hero" keeps appearing near the top for any pop-leaning
or high-energy profile, even the adversarial sad one. It wins because it stacks a
genre bonus with a near-perfect energy match, which can overwhelm the fact that its
mood ("intense") has nothing to do with a "happy" or "sad" request. Similarly, the
adversarial profile still returned pop songs at the top — the scorer silently dropped
the invalid "sad" mood rather than flagging the mismatch.

**Tests.** `tests/test_recommender.py` covers the loading and scoring math. Beyond
that, the profile comparisons above served as the main behavioral check.

---

## 8. Future Work

1. **Fuzzy matching for categorical fields.** Let "indie pop" partially match
   "pop", and let moods live on a similarity graph ("focused" ≈ "chill" ≈
   "relaxed") so the scorer stops treating near-matches as zero.
2. **Input validation.** Warn the user when a requested genre or mood doesn't
   exist in the catalog, instead of silently dropping it.
3. **Diversity penalty in top-K.** Penalize songs from an artist or genre
   already in the list so the top 5 isn't three LoRoom tracks in a row.
4. **Larger, better-balanced catalog.** Add more genres and moods (sad,
   romantic, nostalgic, classical, country) so a "folk fan" gets a real
   ranking within folk, not just "here's the one folk song we have."
5. **Weighted multi-preference profiles.** Let a user say "70% lofi, 30%
   jazz" instead of forcing one favorite genre.

## 9. Personal Reflection

**Biggest learning moment.** I assumed the weights on genre, mood, and
energy would all pull roughly equally on the rankings. Running the
weight-shift experiment showed me how wrong that intuition was — the top-1
pick was remarkably stable (no weight change moved it), while the middle of
the list was extremely sensitive. That changed how I think about "tuning" a
recommender: most of the action happens in ranks 2–10, not at the top.

**Where AI helped vs. where I had to double-check.** Claude was fastest at
mechanical scaffolding — expanding `main.py` to loop over profiles, drafting
the model-card section headers, even sanity-checking that my reverted
weights actually matched the originals. Where I had to slow down was
*interpreting* results: the AI happily produced plausible-sounding
explanations for rankings, and I had to verify those against the actual
score breakdowns before trusting them. The scoring math is simple enough
that I could check it by hand, and more than once that caught a
"plausible-but-wrong" claim.

**What surprised me.** How quickly four lines of arithmetic start to *feel*
like a recommendation. The explanations ("genre match (lofi) +2.0; mood
match (chill) +1.0; energy sim +1.00") read like a real product, even
though the logic is basically a weighted sum. It made me appreciate that a
lot of what we experience as "the algorithm" in Spotify or YouTube is less
magical than we think — it's just a scored ranking with more features and
much more data.

**What I'd try next.** Fuzzy genre matching and a diversity penalty in the
top-K. Both would address the two failure modes I saw most: "filter bubble"
effects from strict genre equality, and near-duplicate top lists dominated
by a single artist.
